<p>
- First,we install a Internet Information Service (IIS) in our virture machice to run osticket on. In our virture machine we hit the window command start button and select control panel option, double click to open its windowns on/off features. At this point, we activated our IIS and CGI features. Then we use the loop function 127.0.0.1 to default web page, to verify we have a working web server and it should look like the photo above. From here on it is our web browser and user have access to helpdesk system.

</p>
<p>Next we create a Directory in our Windows C Drive. To do that, we create a new folder and named it C/PHP, and then unzip osticket installation zip files into folder created.

</p>
<p>Next we install MYSQL.This is our database that osticket use to store all of our data in. From all the users account, ticketing informations, in the backend. After installing, we launch MYSQL configuration wizards and choose standard configurations. After that, we registered PHP manager within IIS, think of it as making IIS aware of the existing file on the computer. Then we stop and restart the web server, from this point we open the osticket zip file and install osticket.

</p>
<p>Finally osticket. Once osTicket is installed and you see the setup page:
	‚Ä¢	Provide your database credentials (from MySQL or MariaDB).
	‚Ä¢	Set your Helpdesk Name, Default Email Address, and Admin Account credentials.
	‚Ä¢	Wait until the installer confirms that the setup is successful.

‚öôÔ∏è 2. Adjust IIS Configuration

To make osTicket run smoothly:
	‚Ä¢	Enable URL Rewrite:
Make sure the IIS URL Rewrite module is installed (it‚Äôs similar to mod_rewrite in Apache).
üëâ Download it from Microsoft‚Äôs site if missing.
	‚Ä¢	Set Folder Permissions:
</p>
<br />
üß∞ 3. Set File & Folder Security

After installation:
	‚Ä¢	Delete or rename the /setup folder.
	‚Ä¢	Verify that /include/ost-config.php is read-only (it contains your database credentials).
  üì® 4. Configure Email (SMTP & POP/IMAP)

Email integration is critical for ticket automation:
	‚Ä¢	Go to Admin Panel ‚Üí Emails ‚Üí Settings.
	‚Ä¢	Add your SMTP outgoing mail (for sending ticket updates).
	‚Ä¢	Add your IMAP or POP mailboxes (for fetching support emails into tickets).

‚∏ª

üë• 5. Create Departments, Agents & Help Topics

Organize your helpdesk:

	‚Ä¢	Audit Logs / Reports
Install from the /include/plugins directory and enable them via the Admin Panel.

‚∏ª

üîí 7. Secure and Optimize

	‚Ä¢	Set a backup schedule for your database and configuration files.
	‚Ä¢	Update to the latest osTicket version to patch vulnerabilities.
	‚Ä¢	Optionally, configure application pool recycling in IIS to keep performance stable.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ 8. Test the System
	‚Ä¢	Create a test ticket as a user.
	‚Ä¢	Respond as an agent and verify that emails and status changes work correctly.
	‚Ä¢	Check URL paths, images, and permissions are functioning properly.
